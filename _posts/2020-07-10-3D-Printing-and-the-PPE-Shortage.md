At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic I decided to find a way to help out. There were many initiatives that seemed to be making real change but an obvious one that could make a real difference was finding alternatives to fill the shortfall of PPE. I came across a group called 3dCrowd.UK who had implemented the organisation and distribution structure to make visors and decided that they would be the best way to help out.
# The Visors

The visors that were widely adopted and approved by many health boards around the world were the [Prusa RC3](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/25857-prusa-protective-face-shield-rc3) designed by Prusa Research. They strike the balance between printability and usability well which many other designs failed to do. Some designs such as the [Verkstan](https://3dverkstan.se/protective-visor/) design sacrificed the comfort of the user for decreased print time by making the band thinner which was not accepted by most health boards (leading to a lot of [waste](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/health/nhs-face-shields-coronavirus-ppe-18084027)).
# 3DCrowd.uk
Across the world many organisations emerged to coordinate the printing efforts. In the UK [3DCrowd](https://3dcrowd.uk/) formed to undertake the logistical and legislative requirements creating a standard operating procedure to ensure the face shields were of sufficient quality as well as creating an online ordering system to make it easier for the shields to be accessed. 

3DCrowd is also attempting to get the Prusa design, 3DCrowd production combination CE marked in order for the visors to be made available to people other than the NHS (at the beginning of the pandemic the government decided that non CE marked PPE and medical devices could be used by the NHS at their discretion).

# Thoughts
This effort to help out taught me a great deal about 3D printing. Not only did it teach me practical skills related to printer maintenance and slicing optimisation but it also opened my eyes to the potential for 3D printing, which is typically thought of as a method for producing prototypes or very low volume products, as a method for manufacturing products at a much higher volume.
