Hi,

I am an Astrophysics student at the University of Cambridge. I have a broad variety of interests in science and programming. At the moment I am working on:
- [CamPyRoS](https://github.com/cuspaceflight/campyros) - a Python package which provides fully featured rocket trajectory simulation 
- Learning Julia in preparation for my summer research placement
But my time is mainly dominated by preparing for exams.

Please checkout my [GitHub](https://github.com/jagoosw) which is likely to be more up to date than here. Here are some of my GitHub stats:
