I"]<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I am an Astrophysics student at the University of Cambridge. I have a broad variety of interests in science and programming. At the moment I am working on:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/cuspaceflight/campyros">CamPyRoS</a> - a Python package which provides fully featured rocket trajectory simulation</li>
  <li>Learning Julia in preparation for my summer research placement
But my time is mainly dominated by preparing for exams.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please checkout my <a href="https://github.com/jagoosw">GitHub</a> which is likely to be more up to date than here. Here are some of my GitHub stats:</p>
