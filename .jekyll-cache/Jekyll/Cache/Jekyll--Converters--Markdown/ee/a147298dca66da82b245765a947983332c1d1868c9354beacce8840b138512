I"r<p>As my interest was caught by <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2020-07-10-3D-Printing-and-the-PPE-Shortage">printing visors</a> at the begining of the COVID-19 pandemic was still trying to find other ways to help. Initially I thought that the shortages of masks was too complicated a problem to be solved without large financial backing and a proper supply chain. Visors have a clear, testable purpose and so can easily be replicated with little experties but that didn’t seem to be the case with masks which also seemed to be too vital a piece of equipment to make half heartedly. I did become involved in a <a href="https://www.helpfulengineering.org/">Helpful Engineering</a> project to create an open source powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) hood where I helped to create specifcations based on the European standards requirments but this project lost momentum.</p>

<p>When I was trying to revise for my exams, and so of course had the urge to read any science as long as it wasn’t examinable, it became apparent to me that no matter how complicated masks were people were going to try and replicate them with little to no expertiese or research. This greatly concerned me because I saw people wearing inadequate masks as a real risk and so decided that I would try and find out how it could be done with the maximum safety.</p>

<p>As part of my contribution to the Helpful Engineering project I had read the European standards relating to masks and so had a good understanding of what was needed from them. With this knowledge I began reading papers about the filtering efficiency of different materials in my spare time with no real end goal in mind. It was only when I decided it would be a good idea to collate all the things I had read in order to come to some conclusion that I thought it would be a good idea to present it as a review.</p>

<p>It turns out that it is possible to make quite a good masks with only household items. It was supprising just how many papers their were showing that cotton is quite a good filter (~70% efficiency), quite a few of them were from the Cold War when filtering radioative particles was a concern. I was disapointed by the lack of papers investigating other materials but concluded that there was some evidence that adding layers of other materials such as silk or chiffon/lycra could grealty increase the filtering (&gt;90% effieicency) of SARS-CoV-2 sized particles. I focused on particles in the size range of the virus but could, in retrospect, investigated more the droplet filtering abilities of the materials.</p>

<p>I then turned to looking into different designs. This is a frustrating line of investigation as the actual design doesn’t really matter as long as it meets the two basic criteria: some what comfortable and sealed to your face. It is very hard to generalise or to make real reccomendations on this front as there is no way for the public to test the seal criteria and so all that can really be done is to look at designs that certifiably fit other people and use your intuition/the feel of the flow around the mask (you can feel if the air is flowing past your nose for example).</p>

<p>While it would be more satisfying for people to be properly protected it is comforting to know that it is possible, with a little research and effort, to create a mask that is quite effective protection.</p>

<p>My paper can be found at <a href="https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202006.0132/v1">Preprints.org</a> and an article that I wrote for a popular science magazine can be found at <a href="https://www.bluesci.co.uk/posts/helping-on-the-homefront-homemade-face-masks-and-how-to-make-them-better">Bluesci.co.uk</a>.</p>

<h2 id="side-note-we-should-all-wear-masks">Side note: we <strong>should</strong> all wear masks</h2>
<p>When I set out to write my review I decided that I did not want it to be at all about whether we should wear masks or not. While it is an apparenly contentious topic it seems clear that from a scientific standpoint it is not. I think that this is well layed out by Professor Greenhalgh from the University of Oxford in these two articles: <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1435">Face masks for the public during the covid-19 crisis</a> and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jep.13415">Face coverings for the public: Laying straw men to rest</a>. In these articles Professor Greenhalgh urges policy makers to encorage the public to wear masks and makes it clear that, although there isn’t a huge amount of evidence for their protection, there is some and there is absolutely no evidence that they cause harm and so by the precortinaty principle mask wearing should be encoraged.</p>
